-Hello! My name is Harrison Wilkinson, but I go by Cole
-Programming really grasped my interest over the several month hiatus from normal life thanks to COVID
-I've been taught Java in a high school class, and we worked in C++ in my first year of college
-However, all of my individual projects are written in Python. I found it was the easiest way to learn how to "think like a programmer"
-It's become a passion of mine, and I hope I can continue to improve as time goes on
